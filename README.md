## A guide for creating a local account on Windows 11, instead of using a microsoft account.

Start your windows install with no network connection **(i.e. unplug the machine's ethernet or don't allow a wifi connection in setup).**

Continue the install as usual, until you reach this prompt:

Once here, open **command prompt** by pressing **SHIFT+F10** together on your keyboard.

Once the command prompt window is open, it should look like this:

Type into the command prompt window the following:

**start ms-cxh:localonly**

It should look like this:

Hit **ENTER**

You should see a dialog to create a local profile like:

Set your user and password. Hit **ENTER** when finished and continue set up.

When at desktop, you can now **plug in your ethernet**, or **connect to a wifi network**.

### Congrats! You are now using a local user profile on Windows 11!!!
